// BucketApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the Bucket type for use

// Bucket defines a token bucket rate limiter configuration.
//
// This rate limiter uses the token bucket algorithm to control the rate of operations.
// Tokens are added to the bucket at a rate of Qps per second, up to a maximum of Bucket tokens.
// Each operation consumes one token. This allows for bursts of activity up to the bucket size
// while maintaining an average rate of Qps operations per second.
//
