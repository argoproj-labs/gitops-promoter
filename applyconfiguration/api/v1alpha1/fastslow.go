// with apply.

// FastSlow defines a rate limiter that uses different delays based on failure count.
//
// This rate limiter returns FastDelay for the first MaxFastAttempts failures, then switches
// to SlowDelay for all subsequent failures. This is useful for quickly retrying transient
// errors while backing off for persistent failures, without the exponential growth of
// ExponentialFailure.
