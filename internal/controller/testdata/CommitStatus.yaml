    # This label is used to define the "key" of the commit status. The value is referenced via the `key` field in a
    # PromotionStrategy's (or ChangeTransferPolicy's) `activeCommitStatuses` or `proposedCommitStatuses` field.
    #
    # CommitStatuses should be unique per key/sha combination. For example, there may be one CommitStatus with the key
    # `example` for shas abc123 and def456, but there should not be two CommitStatuses with the key `example` for sha
    # abc123.
