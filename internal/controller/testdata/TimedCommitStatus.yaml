  # List of environments to monitor for time-based gating

  # 1. Check how long the active commit has been running
  # 2. Create a CommitStatus for the NEXT environment's proposed SHA
  # 3. Set the CommitStatus phase based on whether duration is met
  environments:

    # Creates a CommitStatus gating promotion to staging
