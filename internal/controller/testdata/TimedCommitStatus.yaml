  # List of environments to monitor for time-based gating
  # For each environment, the controller will:
  # 1. Check how long the active commit has been running
  # 2. Create a CommitStatus for the CURRENT environment's active SHA
  # 3. Set the CommitStatus phase based on whether duration is met
  environments:
    # Monitor development environment
    # Creates an active CommitStatus that gates promotions from development
    - branch: environment/development
      duration: 1h

    # Monitor staging environment
    # Creates an active CommitStatus that gates promotions from staging
    - branch: environment/staging
      duration: 4h

    # Monitor production environment
    # Creates an active CommitStatus for production (useful for audit/compliance)
    - branch: environment/production
      duration: 24h
