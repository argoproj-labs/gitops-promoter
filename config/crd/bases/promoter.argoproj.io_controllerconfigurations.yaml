              ControllerConfigurationSpec defines the desired state of ControllerConfiguration.

              This spec contains the global configuration for all controllers in the promoter system.
              Each controller has its own configuration section that specifies WorkQueue settings,
              rate limiters, and other controller-specific parameters. All fields should be required,
              with defaults set in manifests rather than in code.

              argocdCommitStatus:
                description: |-
                  ArgoCDCommitStatus contains the configuration for the ArgoCDCommitStatus controller,
                  including WorkQueue settings that control reconciliation behavior.

                    description: |-
                      WatchLocalApplications controls whether the controller monitors Argo CD Applications
                      in the local cluster. When false, the controller will only watch Applications in remote clusters
                      configured via kubeconfig secrets. This is useful when the Argo CD Application CRD is not installed
                      in the local cluster or when all Applications are deployed to remote clusters.

                          that can run for this controller. Higher values increase throughput but consume more
                          resources. Must be at least 1.

                          RateLimiter defines the rate limiting strategy for the controller's work queue.
                          Rate limiting controls how quickly failed reconciliations are retried and helps
                          prevent overwhelming external APIs or systems.

                                  Bucket is the maximum number of tokens that can be accumulated in the bucket.

                              Useful for quickly retrying transient errors while backing off for persistent failures.

                          RequeueDuration specifies how frequently resources should be requeued for automatic reconciliation.
                          This creates a periodic reconciliation loop that ensures the desired state is maintained even
                          without external triggers. Format follows Go's time.Duration syntax (e.g., "5m" for 5 minutes).

              ControllerConfigurationStatus defines the observed state of ControllerConfiguration.

              Currently, this resource does not maintain any status information as it is a configuration-only
              resource. Status fields may be added in the future to track configuration validation or
              controller health metrics.
