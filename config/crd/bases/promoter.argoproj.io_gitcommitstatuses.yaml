          GitCommitStatus is the Schema for the gitcommitstatuses API.

          It validates commits from PromotionStrategy environments using configurable expressions
          and creates CommitStatus resources with the validation results.

          IMPORTANT DESIGN: GitCommitStatus validates the ACTIVE (currently deployed) commit but
          reports the validation result on the PROPOSED commit. This enables state-based gating
          where you validate the current environment state before allowing promotion of new changes.

          Workflow:
           1. Controller reads PromotionStrategy to get ProposedHydratedSha and ActiveHydratedSha
           2. Controller fetches commit data (subject, body, author, trailers) for ACTIVE SHA
           3. Controller evaluates expression against ACTIVE commit data
           4. Controller creates/updates CommitStatus with result attached to PROPOSED SHA
           5. PromotionStrategy checks CommitStatus on PROPOSED SHA before allowing promotion

          This design supports use cases like:
            - "Ensure active commit is not a revert before promoting"

              expression:
                description: |-
                  Expression is evaluated using the expr library (github.com/expr-lang/expr) against commit data
                  for environments in the referenced PromotionStrategy.
                  The expression must return a boolean value where true indicates the validation passed.

                  IMPORTANT: The controller validates the ACTIVE (currently deployed) commit but reports the
                  validation result on the PROPOSED commit. This design enables state-based gating where you
                  validate the current environment state before allowing promotion of new changes.

                  Use cases:
                    - "Don't promote until active commit has required sign-offs"
                    - "Verify current deployment meets compliance before next promotion"
                    - "Ensure active commit passed time-based checks before moving forward"

                  The expression is compiled once and cached for performance. Multiple evaluations of the
                  same expression reuse the compiled version.

                  Available variables in the expression context:
                    - Commit.SHA (string): the ACTIVE hydrated commit SHA being validated
                    - Commit.Subject (string): the first line of the commit message
                    - Commit.Body (string): the commit message body (everything after the subject line)
                    - Commit.Author (string): commit author email address
                    - Commit.Committer (string): committer email address
                    - Commit.Trailers (map[string][]string): git trailers parsed from commit message

                  The expr library provides built-in functions and operators:
                    - String operations: startsWith(s, prefix), endsWith(s, suffix), contains(s, substr)
                    - Regex matching: string matches "pattern" (infix operator)
                    - Logical operators: &&, ||, !
                    - Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
                    - Collections: "key" in map to check map key existence, len() for length

                  Example expressions:
                    'endsWith(Commit.Author, "@example.com")'
                    '"Signed-off-by" in Commit.Trailers'
                    'contains(Commit.Body, "JIRA-") && "Reviewed-by" in Commit.Trailers'
                    'len(Commit.Trailers["Reviewed-by"]) >= 2'
                    'Commit.Subject matches "^(feat|fix|docs):"'
