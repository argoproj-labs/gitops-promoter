          GitCommitStatus is the Schema for the gitcommitstatuses API.

          It validates commits from PromotionStrategy environments using configurable expressions
          and creates CommitStatus resources with the validation results.

          Use the Target field to control which commit is validated:
          - "active" (default): Validates the currently deployed commit
          - "proposed": Validates the incoming commit

          The validation result is always reported on the PROPOSED commit to enable promotion gating,
          regardless of which commit was validated.

          Workflow:
           1. Controller reads PromotionStrategy to get ProposedHydratedSha and ActiveHydratedSha
           2. Controller selects SHA to validate based on Target field
           3. Controller fetches commit data (subject, body, author, trailers) for selected SHA
           4. Controller evaluates expression against selected commit data
           5. Controller creates/updates CommitStatus with result attached to PROPOSED SHA
           6. PromotionStrategy checks CommitStatus on PROPOSED SHA before allowing promotion

          Common use cases:
            - "Ensure active commit is not a revert before promoting"

                  Description is a human-readable description of this validation that will be shown in the SCM provider
                  (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) as the commit status description.

              expression:
                description: |-
                  Expression is evaluated using the expr library (github.com/expr-lang/expr) against commit data
                  for environments in the referenced PromotionStrategy.
                  The expression must return a boolean value where true indicates the validation passed.

                  The commit validated is determined by the Target field:
                  - "active" (default): Validates the ACTIVE (currently deployed) commit
                  - "proposed": Validates the PROPOSED commit (what will be promoted)

                  The validation result is always reported on the PROPOSED commit to enable promotion gating.

                  Use Cases by Mode:
                    Active mode: State-based gating - validate current environment before allowing promotion
                      - "Don't promote until active commit has required sign-offs"
                      - "Verify current deployment meets compliance before next promotion"
                      - "Ensure active commit is not a revert before promoting"

                    Proposed mode: Change-based gating - validate the incoming change itself
                      - "Don't promote unless new commit follows naming convention"
                      - "Ensure proposed commit has proper JIRA ticket reference"
                      - "Require specific author for proposed changes"

                  Available variables in the expression context:
                    - Commit.SHA (string): the commit SHA being validated (active or proposed based on Target)
                    - Commit.Subject (string): the first line of the commit message
                    - Commit.Body (string): the commit message body (everything after the subject line)
                    - Commit.Author (string): commit author email address
