          GitCommitStatus is the Schema for the gitcommitstatuses API.
          It validates commits from PromotionStrategy environments using configurable expressions
          and creates CommitStatus resources with the validation results.

              expression:
                description: |-
                  Expression is evaluated using the expr library (github.com/expr-lang/expr) against commit data
                  for ALL environments in the referenced PromotionStrategy.
                  The expression must return a boolean value where true indicates the validation passed.

                  Available variables in the expression context:
                    - Commit.SHA (string): the proposed hydrated commit SHA being validated
                    - Commit.Message (string): full commit message including body
                    - Commit.Author (string): commit author email address
                    - Commit.Committer (string): committer email address
                    - Commit.Trailers (map[string][]string): git trailers parsed from commit message

                  The expr library provides built-in functions and operators:
                    - String operations: startsWith(s, prefix), endsWith(s, suffix), contains(s, substr)
                    - Regex matching: string matches "pattern" (infix operator)
                    - Logical operators: &&, ||, !
                    - Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
                    - Collections: "key" in map to check map key existence, len() for length

                  Example expressions:
                    'endsWith(Commit.Author, "@example.com")'
                    '"Signed-off-by" in Commit.Trailers'
                    'contains(Commit.Message, "JIRA-") && "Reviewed-by" in Commit.Trailers'
                    'len(Commit.Trailers["Reviewed-by"]) >= 2'
                    'Commit.Message matches "^(feat|fix|docs):"'
                    'startsWith(Commit.Message, "Revert")'
