          WebRequestCommitStatus is the Schema for the webrequestcommitstatuses API.

          It makes HTTP requests to external endpoints and evaluates the response using expressions
          to create CommitStatus resources with the validation results.

          The controller polls the configured URL at the specified Polling.Interval.
          When reportOn is "proposed", polling stops after success for a given SHA.
          When reportOn is "active", polling continues forever.

          Workflow:
           1. Controller reads PromotionStrategy to get ProposedHydratedSha and ActiveHydratedSha
           2. Controller renders URL, Headers, and Body templates with SHA context
           3. Controller makes HTTP request with optional authentication
           4. Controller evaluates expression against response
           5. Controller creates/updates CommitStatus with result attached to the SHA specified by reportOn
           6. Controller requeues based on Polling.Interval and success state
