  # This expression returns false if ANY of these conditions are true:
  # 1. Commit subject starts with "Revert" → fail
  # 2. Commit body starts with "Revert" → fail
  # 3. Commit has a "Git-commit-status: pending" trailer → fail
  # The validation passes only if NONE of these conditions are true
  # Note: startsWith is an infix operator, 'in' is used to check map key existence
